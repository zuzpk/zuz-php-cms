                <p class="mm s16"><a href="tdnh">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> is the toughest privacy and security law in the world. Though it was drafted and passed by the European Union (EU), it imposes obligations onto organizations anywhere, so long as they target or collect data related to people in the EU. The regulation was put into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR will heavily fine those who violate its privacy and security standards, with penalties reaching into the tens of millions of euros or 4% of annual turnover.</p>
