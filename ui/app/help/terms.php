                Unless otherwise explicitly stated and without prejudice to applicable statutory product liability provisions, Users shall have no right to claim damages against the Owner (or any natural or legal person acting on its behalf).
                This does not apply to damages to life, health or physical integrity, damages resulting from the breach of an essential contractual obligation such as any obligation strictly necessary to achieve the purpose of the contract, and/or damages resulting from intent or gross negligence, as long as <?php echo APP_NAME; ?> has been appropriately and correctly used by the User.
                Unless damages have been caused by way of intent or gross negligence, or they affect life, health or physical integrity, the Owner shall only be liable to the extent of typical and foreseeable damages at the moment the contract was entered into.
                In particular, within the limits stated above, the Owner shall not be liable for:
                <ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>any losses that are not the direct consequence of a breach of the Terms by the Owner;</li>
                    <li>any loss of business opportunities and any other loss, even indirect, that may be incurred by the User (such as, but not limited to, trading losses, loss of revenue, income, profits or anticipated savings, loss of contracts or business relationships, loss of reputation or goodwill, etc.);</li>
                    <li>damages or losses resulting from interruptions or malfunctions of <?php echo APP_NAME; ?> due to acts of force majeure, or unforeseen and unforeseeable events and, in any case, independent of the will and beyond the control of the Owner, such as, but not limited to, failures or disruptions of telephone or electrical lines, the Internet and / or other means of transmission, unavailability of websites, strikes, natural disasters, viruses and cyber attacks, interruptions in the delivery of products, third-party services or applications;</li>
                    <li>any damage, prejudice or loss occurring due to viruses or other malware contained in or connected to files available for download from the internet or via <?php echo APP_NAME; ?>. Users are responsible for implementing sufficient security measures – such as anti-viruses and firewalls to prevent any such infection or attack and for securing backup copies of all data or information exchanged via or uploaded to <?php echo APP_NAME; ?>.</li>
                    <li>Notwithstanding the above, the following limitation applies to all Users not qualifying as Consumers:</li>
                    <li>In any event of liability, the compensation may not exceed the total payments that have been, will be or would be received by the Owner from the User based on the contract over a period of 12 months, or the period of the duration of the Agreement, if shorter.</li>
