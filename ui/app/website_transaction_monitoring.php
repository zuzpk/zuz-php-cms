            <p class="mm s16">We are extra careful about confirming an outage. That's why we check your transaction three times from different locations if we find that something has gone wrong. You will only be alerted if all three secondary checks confirm that your transaction is broken and your team needs to investigate the cause immediately.</p>

It means that even if one of the data-centers we use goes down, we can continue our service and monitor your websites. Also, we use 171 probes around the world. It makes our service almost impossible to go down.</p>
